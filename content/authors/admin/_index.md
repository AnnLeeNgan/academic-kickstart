I am an associate professor in the Department of Statistics & Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University, with a joint appointment in the Machine Learning Department. My research interests are in developing statistical methodology for the type of complex data and problems often encountered in the physical sciences. I am particularly interested in computationally and statistically efficient methods that adapt to the intrinsic structure of the data, and nonparametric approaches that can handle different types of data, such as heterogeneous data arriving from multiple scientific probes. My recent work includes uncertainty quantification via conditional density estimation, faster alternatives to approximate Bayesian computing with statistical guarantees, validation of emulators, and applications in astronomy and hurricane intensity guidance involving satellite imagery and massive astronomical surveys.
